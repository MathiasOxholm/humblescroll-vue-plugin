# TailwindCSS

## No bloat

By leveraging the power of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), HumbleScroll allows you to animate your components with just a few utility classes.

The only CSS your site loads when adding HumbleScroll is the default variables and the basic logic for the animations. The rest is up to you. This means no unnecessary CSS is loaded on your site.
